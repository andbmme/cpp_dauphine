## Command line cheatsheet

- ls         : list files and subdirectories in the current directory
- cd path    : changes directory to subdirectory path
- cd ..      : changes directory to the upper one containing the current directory
- mkdir name : creates a new subdirectory called name
- rm file    : removes the file named file
- rm -r dir  : removes the subdirectory dir and all it contains

The TAB key can be used to autocomplete. For instance, if you want to `cd` in `my_super_long_directory`,
just type `cd my_s` and hit the TAB key.
